<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.jpg" width="50" height="56" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">
WITH deep reverence I inscribe
these lines, my dear parents, to
you. I see you now, away beyond
the seas, beyond the lands
where the sun goes down in the Pacific like
some great ship of fire, resting still on the
green hills, watching your herds, waiting</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="left25">  "Where rolls the Oregon,</span><br />
And hears no sound save its own dashing."</p>

<p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago you took
me the long and lonesome half-year's journey
across the mighty continent, wild, and rent,
and broken up, and sown with sand and ashes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
and crossed by tumbling, wooded rivers that
ran as if glad to get away, fresh and strange
and new as if but half-fashioned from the hand
of God.</p>

<p>All the time as I tread this strange land I
re-live those scenes, and you are with me.
How dark and deep, how sullen, strong, and
lion-like the mighty Missouri rolled between
his walls of untracked wood and cleft the
unknown domain of the middle world before
us!</p>

<p>Then the frail and buffeted rafts on the
river, the women and children huddled together,
the shouts of the brawny men as they
swam with the bellowing cattle; the cows in
the stormy stream, eddying, whirling, spinning
about, calling to their young, their bright
horns shining in the sun.... The wild men
waiting on the other side, painted savages
leaning silent on their bows, despising our
weakness, opening a way, letting us pass on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
to the unknown distances, where they said the
sun and moon lay down together and brought
forth the stars.... The long and winding
lines of wagons, the graves by the wayside,
the women weeping together as they passed
on. Then hills, then plains, parched lands
like Syria, dust, and ashes, and alkali, cool
streams with woods, camps by night, great
wood fires in circles, tents in the centre like
CÃ¦sar's battle-camps, painted men that passed
like shadows, showers of arrows, the wild
beasts howling from the hill....</p>

<p>You, my dear parents, will pardon the thread
of fiction on which I have strung these scenes
and descriptions of a mighty land of mystery,
and wild and savage grandeur, for the world
will have its way, and, like a spoiled child,
demands a tale.</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="left15">       "Yea,</span><br />
We who toil and earn our bread<br />
Still have our masters...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span></p>

<p>A ragged and broken story it is, with long
deserts, with alkali and ashes, yet it may, like
the land it deals of, have some green places,
and woods, and running waters, where you can
rest....</p>

<p>Three times now I have ranged the great
West in fancy, as I did in fact for twenty years,
and gathered unknown and unnamed blossoms
from mountain-top, from desert level, where
man never ranged before, and asked the world
to receive my weeds, my grasses, and blue-eyed
blossoms. But here it ends. Good or bad, I
have done enough of this work on the border.
The Orient promises a more grateful harvest.</p>

<p>I have been true to my West. She has been
my only love. I have remembered her greatness.
I have done my work to show to the
world her vastness, her riches, her resources,
her valor and her dignity, her poetry and her
grandeur. Yet while I was going on, working
so in silence, what were the things she said of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
me? But let that pass, my dear parents.
Others will come after us. Possibly I have
blazed out the trail for great minds over this
field, as you did across the deserts and plains
for great men a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<div class="drop-cap">A MAN in middle Aridzone</div>
<div class="i3">Stood by the desert's edge alone,</div>
<div class="i3">And long he look'd, and lean'd. He peer'd,</div>
<div class="line">Above his twirl'd and twisted beard,</div>

<div class="line i1">  A skin-clad trapper, toe-a-tip,</div>

<div class="line">"It looks so like some lonesome ship

<div class="line i1">  A chief from out the desert's rim</div>

<div class="line">Or eagle blown from eyrie nest.</div>
<div class="line">His trim-limb'd steed was black as night,</div>
<div class="line">His long black hair had blossom'd white,</div>
<div class="line">With feathers from the koko's crest;</div>
<div class="line">His iron face was flush'd and red,</div>
<div class="line">His eyes flash'd fire as he fled,</div>
<div class="line">For he had seen unsightly things;</div>
<div class="line">Had felt the flapping of their wings.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  A wild and wiry man was he,</div>
<div class="line">This tawny chief of Shoshonee;</div>
<div class="line">And O his supple steed was fleet!</div>
<div class="line">About his breast flapp'd panther skins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></div>
<div class="line">About his eager flying feet</div>
<div class="line">Flapp'd beaded, braided moccasins:</div>
<div class="line">He rode as rides the hurricane;</div>
<div class="line">He seem'd to swallow up the plain;</div>
<div class="line">He rode as never man did ride,</div>
<div class="line">He rode, for ghosts rode at his side,</div>
<div class="line">And on his right a grizzled grim&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">No, no, this tale is not of him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  An Indian warrior lost his way</div>
<div class="line">While prowling on this desert's edge</div>
<div class="line">In fragrant sage and prickly hedge,</div>
<div class="line">When suddenly he saw a sight,</div>
<div class="line">And turn'd his steed in eager flight.</div>
<div class="line">He rode right through the edge of day,</div>
<div class="line">He rode into the rolling night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  He lean'd, he reach'd an eager face,</div>
<div class="line">His black wolf skin flapp'd out and in,</div>
<div class="line">And tiger claws on tiger skin

<div class="line">Held seat and saddle to its place;</div>
<div class="line">But that gray ghost that clutch'd thereat ...</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  A chieftain touch'd the desert's rim</div>
<div class="line">One autumn eve: he rode alone</div>
<div class="line">And still as moon-made shadows swim.</div>
<div class="line">He stopp'd, he stood as still as stone,</div>
<div class="line">He lean'd, he look'd, there glisten'd bright</div>
<div class="line">From out the yellow yielding sand</div>
<div class="line">A golden cup with jewell'd rim.</div>
<div class="line">He lean'd him low, he reach'd a hand,</div>
<div class="line">He caught it up, he gallop'd on,</div>
<div class="line">He turn'd his head, he saw a sight ...</div>
<div class="line">His panther skins flew to the wind,</div>
<div class="line">The dark, the desert lay behind;</div>
<div class="line">The tawny Ishmaelite was gone;</div>
<div class="line">But something sombre as death is ...</div>
<div class="line">Tut, tut! the tale is not of this.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  A mountaineer, storm-stained and brown,</div>
<div class="line">From farthest desert touched the town,</div>
<div class="line">And, striding through the crowd, held up</div>
<div class="line">Above his head a jewell'd cup.</div>
<div class="line">He put two fingers to his lip,</div>
<div class="line">He whisper'd wild, he stood a-tip,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  An Indian hunter held a plate</div>
<div class="line">Of gold above his lifted head,</div>
<div class="line">Around which kings had sat in state ...</div>

<div class="line">Ere yet the red men drew the bow."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  But wrinkled women wagg'd the head,</div>
<div class="line">And walls of warriors sat that night</div>
<div class="line">In black, nor streak of battle red,</div>
<div class="line">Around against the red camp light,</div>
<div class="line">And told such wondrous tales as these</div>
<div class="line">Of wealth within their dried-up seas.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  And one, girt well in tiger's skin,</div>
<div class="line">Who stood, like Saul, above the rest,</div>
<div class="line">With dangling claws about his breast,</div>
<div class="line">A belt without, a blade within,</div>
<div class="line">A warrior with a painted face,</div>
<div class="line">And lines that shadow'd stern and grim,</div>
<div class="line">Stood pointing east from his high place,</div>
<div class="line">And hurling thought like cannon shot,</div>
<div class="line">Stood high with visage flush'd and hot ...</div>
<div class="line">But, stay! this tale is not of him.</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  They tented in a canÃ±on's mouth</div>

<div class="line">Where now nor rains nor winds may fall,</div>
<div class="line">They delved the level salt-white sands</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1">  A miner stood beside his mine,</div>

<div class="line">"It looks so like a sea," said he.</div>
<div class="line">He pull'd his beard, and he did say,</div>
<div class="line">"It looks just like a dried-up sea."</div>
<div class="line">Again he pull'd that beard of his,</div>

<div class="line i1">  A stalwart miner dealt a stroke,</div>
<div class="line">And struck a buried beam of oak.</div>
<div class="line">An old ship's beam the shaft appear'd,</div>
<div class="line">With storm-worn faded figure-head.</div>
<div class="line">The miner twisted, twirled his beard,</div>
<div class="line">Lean'd on his pick-axe as he spoke:</div>
<div class="line">"'Tis from some long-lost ship," he said,</div>
<div class="line">"Some laden ship of Solomon</div>
<div class="line">That sail'd these lonesome seas upon</div>
<div class="line">In search of Ophir's mine, ah me!</div>
<div class="line">That sail'd this dried-up desert sea." ...</div>
